# 📈 Demand Forecasting for Retail Sales

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Time Series Forecasting** to predict future sales trends, helping businesses **optimize inventory and supply chain management**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Shampoo Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Features:** Monthly sales data over a 3-year period
- **Target:** Forecasting future sales based on historical trends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Model:** SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 📌 Features Implemented
✅ Time Series Data Preprocessing  
✅ Data Visualization & Trend Analysis  
✅ Seasonal ARIMA Model Training  
✅ Forecasting & Model Evaluation  

## 📈 Model Performance
| Metric      | Score |
|------------|-------|
| MAE        | 3.45  |
| MSE        | 12.78 |
| RMSE       | 3.57  |
